# GitHub Actions Reuseable Workflows

The main purpose of this repository is to avoid duplication when creating a workflow by reusing existing workflows as per
[Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows). Each directory will have a `README.md`
detailing the various secrets, variables etc. That need to be set for the workflow to work as expected.
