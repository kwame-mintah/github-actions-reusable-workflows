# GitHub Actions Reuseable Workflows

The main purpose of this repository is to avoid duplication when creating a workflow by reusing existing workflows as per
[Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows). See below on how to call each
workflow and what inputs and/or secrets are needed.

See example below on how to use this repository workflows:

```yaml
name: "Call a reusable workflow"

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: kwame-mintah/github-actions-reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/<name>.yml@v1 # could be branch name (main) or git commit id (15ebb92...)
```
